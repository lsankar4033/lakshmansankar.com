## About

Present:
Hi, I'm Lakshman and I build technology for fun and profit. I believe the world tends to centralize and I'm
drawn to build things that resist this tendency. I prefer diversity and creativity to optimality.

These days, I spend most of my time working on Ethereum, particularly in privacy. I'll have more to say about
this soon, but for now you can follow my work here: https://github.com/lsankar4033/micromix_relayer.

I also spend some time advising and consulting with companies in the cryptocurrency/blockchain space. I've
been lucky to work on projects with the fantastic folks at RareBits, Lumina, and Oasis Labs. More here:
(insert Alacritas Labs site).

I'm usually working at or near the South Park Commons, an inspiring collective of exploring
technologists.

Past:
I've been fortunate to have had a wonderful life so far. Somehow, I keep finding myself in the right place
at the right time. Some of the experiences I'm particularly fond of:
- canoe camping down the Green River in Southern Utah for a week in 2017
- running the SF marathon in 2019
- traveling solo without a plan in SE Asia for 3 months in 2017
- working on simulation code for LIGO (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIGO) at Columbia University while in
high school
- getting undergraduate degrees in both Physics and Computer Science at MIT
- building and growing AngelList's sponsored jobs product from idea to $50k MRR within 5 months
- managing and developing an ML system that made 600k decisions/second at Liftoff
- co-founding and eventually selling an education technology business (insert link)
