## About

Past:
I've been fortunate to have had a wonderful life so far. Somehow, I keep finding myself in the right place
at the right time. Some of the experiences I'm particularly fond of:
- canoe camping down the Green River in Southern Utah for a week in 2017
- running the SF marathon in 2019
- traveling solo without a plan in SE Asia for 3 months in 2017
- working on simulation code for LIGO (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIGO) at Columbia University while in
high school
- getting undergraduate degrees in both Physics and Computer Science at MIT
- building and growing AngelList's sponsored jobs product from idea to $50k MRR within 5 months
- managing and developing an ML system that made 600k decisions/second at Liftoff
- co-founding and selling an education technology business (insert link)
- (INSERT Breakonomics 2011)
