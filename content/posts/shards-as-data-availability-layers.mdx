title: "Simplifying Eth 2.0: Shards as data availability layers"
date: "09/04/20"

---

Whenever something changes suddenly, people start wondering what's next
for the systems that we've put in place.

The rise of DeFi on Ethereum has brought that sort of questioning into the
smart contract platform space. Ethereum
[gas prices](https://etherscan.io/chart/gasprice) are as high
  as they've ever been. All of this congestion has users and application
developers asking the obvious question: is Ethereum the place to be?

It turns out that that's an incredibly nuanced question with a number of
variables to take into consideration:
  
- 
impending mainnet launch of a number of new L2 solutions

- 
Eth 2.0+sharding progress

- 
new, well-funded layer 1 chains like Solana/Near

- 
community/tooling inertia in Ethereum

- 
app-chain + interoperability technology like Cosmos/Polkadot

- 
the tradeoff b/w interoperability with DeFi primitives and low fees for new applications

It's a lot to keep track of! It doesn't help that many of the narratives in the ecosystem are
driven by the economic incentives of the narrators.

I want to discuss one possible future that I'm really excited about. Using Eth 2.0 shards as a data availability
layer for L2s.

That's an incredibly jargon-y, technical phrase and that's why I think it
hasn't gotten the love in general internet writing that [other ideas](https://haseebq.com/defi-in-eth2-cities-suburbs-and-farms/) have.

My hope is that this is one more mental model of the future that you'll be
able to reference as we all navigate the next 5-10 years.

### 
What's the deal with data availability?

'Data availability' is high on the list of important concepts that aren't
widely understood. It's commonly used in conversation among researchers
but I rarely see it discussed outside of that.

Rather than explain the how, I'll discuss the what of data availability.
  For more on the technical specifics (the how), there are [other](https://github.com/ethereum/research/wiki/A-note-on-data-availability-and-erasure-coding) [excellent](https://dankradfeist.de/ethereum/2019/12/20/data-availability-checks.html) [resources](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09044).

Data availability is a property a blockchain might have. It's helpful to
understand what it's not in addition to what it is.

It's not any guarantee around the integrity of data on the chain. For
  example, knowing that the transactions in a block are being sent from
senders who can afford it asks for *more* than data availability.

It *is* a guarantee that any user (including a light client) can find all
the data in the blockchain.

Here's a visual representation of what a data availability blockchain
gives us

Just an ordered sequence of data elements without any notion of what they
represent. It's perhaps easy to think about as an ordered, permissionless,
append-only database.

We'd need more for a blockchain like Bitcoin or Ethereum; we need a way to
know which transactions are valid and which aren't.

Rather than handle this *in* the blockchain, we could interpret the data
availability blockchain within some 'execution context' that tells us
which chunks are valid and which aren't:

If we're interpreting our blockchain with 'Execution context 1', chunk 1
  represents valid data and chunk 2 represents invalid data. This execution
context can live somewhere else, like layer 2.

The beauty of this approach to blockchains is that it completely separates
data from execution. We can construct one chain that's really fast at
ordering data and handle execution. We can then interpret that data
through a layer 2 execution context, like [Optimistic rollup](https://medium.com/plasma-group/ethereum-smart-contracts-in-l2-optimistic-rollup-2c1cef2ec537).

### 
Eth 2.0 shards as a data availability layer

One possible future of Eth 2.0 sees all but one of the shards becoming
high-throughput data availability blockchains for L2s. The exception shard
  is the same shard that eth1 will [transition into](https://ethresear.ch/t/alternative-proposal-for-early-eth1-eth2-merge/6666) and thus is the only shard that actually has an 'opinion' of what data
represents at the consensus level.

Here's what that might look like:

![](https://i.imgur.com/BrwZiAH.png)

Any worries that cross-shard transactions won't be possible are allayed in
this future. Layer 2 can make use of *all* shards in its transactions.
  Ultimately what economic separation exists between shards is completely up
to the L2s.

And we won't have to wait for
[Phase 2 of Eth 2.0](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/ethereum-2.0/eth-2.0-phases/)
to get there. I'm hesitant to give time estimates, but this makes the
scalable, executable Ethereum dream much more imminent.

This is, of course, just one vision. It's entirely possible that this
world doesn't materialize, but it'll be a big deal if it does.

### 
The new protocol wars are afoot!

We're about to enter a world of unknown unknowns as blockchains and
scaling technologies try to self-actualize in this new high congestion
DeFi regime.

The savvy person will consider many possibilities on a distribution and
follow the space closely to understand what's going on as it develops. I
hope this brief exploration of one possible future adds to the portfolio
of futures that you're considering.

In future posts, I'll dig into a few more.
