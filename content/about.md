Hi, I'm Lakshman. I'm an [Etherean](https://ethereum.org/).
I've spent the last couple years working in R&D and strategy at the
Ethereum Foundation. Prior to that, I was a product/engineering leader at
a number of silicon valley startups, some of my own included.

I'm currently working on [Personae Labs](https://personaelabs.org/). We're building
technology and products around cryptography-native identity.

If you want to work with me, get in touch.
