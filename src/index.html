    <p>
      Hi! My name is <span style="color: #800000;">Lakshman Sankar</span>. It's a pleasure to meet you :).
    </p>

    <p>
      Sometimes I'm a programmer. Other times I'm a growth hacker. Other times I'm a writer.
    </p>

    <p>
      I believe that we're living in an age of <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/titles/8950.html">critical transitions</a>
      because of how quickly we're networking as a society. If we aren't deliberate in our response to these transitions,
      we're sure to be swept up into suboptimal outcomes.

    <p>
      Right now, I'm spending most of my time on blockchains and other peer-to-peer distributed trust networks.
      Cryptography shifts power from institutions with capital to the individual and I believe that these networks
      have the power to completely upend how we've organized ourselves in the past. I find it likely that many of
      the group activities we currently rely on an administrator for will be governed by blockchains in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of my other interests are:
      <ol>
        <li>Functional programming, writing, and math as exercises in clear thinking. I believe that all ideas can
          be cleanly expressed and that doing so can be practiced.
        </li>
        <li>Physical fitness. I share <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/607547-no-man-has-the-right-to-be-an-amateur-in">Socrates' sentiments</a>.
          I love pushing my body to its boundaries and growing through those boundaries. I'm also just an endorphin
          junkie.
        </li>
        <li>AI and Machine Learning. Another important 'critical transition' is the outsourcing of most decision-making
          to machine intelligences. I've spent most of my career and education building and examining such intelligences.
        </li>
      </ol>
