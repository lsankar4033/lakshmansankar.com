      Hi, I'm Lakshman. I do R&D at the
      <a href="https://ethereum.org/">Ethereum Foundation</a>. I'm interested in
      making sure that the protocol serves the application layer. I also like
      hacking (<a href="https://github.com/lsankar4033/">Github</a>) and (very)
      occasionally angel investing/consulting with teams that inspire me.
    </p>

    <br />

    <p>
      When it comes to building a free society, I believe there's a bad way and
      a good way to build systems. I'm committed to exploring the good way. I
      think we should all have a choice in which systems and institutions to be
      a part of.

      In the past, I've been an engineer, data scientist, and startup founder.
      Google me to find me on your favorite professional profile website, but
      don't expect it to be up to date. Better to just see what I'm up to on
      <a href="https://twitter.com/lakshmansankar">Twitter</a> or here.
