      Hi, I'm Lakshman. I'm an <a href="https://ethereum.org/">Etherean</a>.
      I've spent the last couple years working in R&D and strategy at the Ethereum Foundation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most recently, I drove the thinking around supporting the budding proof-of-stake ecosystem after the launch of the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/beacon-chain/">beacon chain</a>.
      One piece of legible work to come out of this was <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/02/09/esp-staking-community-grantee-announcement/">a series of grants</a>. I was also deeply involved in staking pool R&D and thinking through how MEV affects L1 protocol development.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm currently deep in the 'crypto' startup idea maze. The industry is evolving and the time couldn't be better to
      double down on a thesis and build something of decade-scale importance.
    </p>

    <br />

    <p>
      If you want to work with me, get in touch. I also occassionally invest in
      or advise teams that inspire me and am happy to connect in that capacity as
      well.
    </p>

    <br />

    <p>
      When it comes to building a free society, I believe there's a bad way and
      a good way to build systems. I'm committed to exploring the good way. I
      think we should all have a choice in which systems and institutions to be
      a part of.
    </p>

    <br />

    <p>
      In the past, I've been an engineer, data scientist, and startup founder.
      Google me to find me on your favorite professional profile website, but
      don't expect it to be up to date. Better to just see what I'm up to on
      Twitter or this site.
    </p>
