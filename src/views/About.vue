      Hi, I'm Lakshman. I'm an <a href="https://ethereum.org/">Etherean</a>. I've spent the last couple years helping with protocol and ecosystem R&D at the Ethereum Foundation.
      I'm currently deep in the 'crypto' startup idea maze. The industry is evolving and the time couldn't be better to double down on a thesis and build something of decade-scale importance.

      If you want to work with me, get in touch.
      I also occassionally invest in or advise teams that inspire me and happy to connect in that capacity as well.

      When it comes to building a free society, I believe there's a bad way and
      a good way to build systems. I'm committed to exploring the good way. I
      think we should all have a choice in which systems and institutions to be
      a part of.

      In the past, I've been an engineer, data scientist, and startup founder.
      Google me to find me on your favorite professional profile website, but
      don't expect it to be up to date. Better to just see what I'm up to on
      Twitter or this site.
