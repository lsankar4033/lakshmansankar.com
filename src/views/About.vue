      Hi, I'm Lakshman. I work for the
      <a href="https://ethereum.org/">Ethereum Foundation</a> on research and
      engineering. Unless I've forgotten to update this blurb recently, my main
      foci there are Ethereum 2.0 and applications of zero-knowledge proofs.

      When it comes to creating an equitable, free society, I believe there's a
      bad way and a good way to build systems. I'm committed to exploring the
      good way. I think we should all be able to opt in or opt out of systems
      and institutions and retrieve the information to make such decisions.

      In the past, I've been an engineer, data scientist, and founder. I don't
      spend much energy keeping a 'professional profile', but the best you'll
      find is probably on
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lakshman-sankar-72b39831/"
        >LinkedIn</a
      >. Definitely don't message me there though; I never check it.

      If you do want want to chat, twitter and e-mail are inboxes I frequent.
      Please no job offers or ads. Ideas only.
