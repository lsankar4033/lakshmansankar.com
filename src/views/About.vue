      Hi, I'm Lakshman. I work for the <a href="https://ethereum.org/">Ethereum Foundation</a> on research and
      engineering. My main focuses are zero-knowledge proof applications and Ethereum 2.0. I'm optimistic about
      technology as a democratizing force and invest most of my time in that vein.

      In the past, I've been an engineer, data scientist, and founder. My 'professional' profile is
