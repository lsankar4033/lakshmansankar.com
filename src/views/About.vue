      Hi, I'm Lakshman. I'm an <a href="https://ethereum.org/">Etherean</a>.
      I've spent the last couple years working in R&D and strategy at the
      Ethereum Foundation. Prior to that, I was a product/engineering leader at
      a number of silicon valley startups, some of my own included.
    </p>

    <br />

    <p>
      I'm currently deep in the 'crypto' startup idea maze. The industry is
      evolving and the time couldn't be better to double down on a vision and
      build something *new* of century-scale importance.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you want to work with me, get in touch.
