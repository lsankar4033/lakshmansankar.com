      Hi, I'm Lakshman. I do crypto/blockchain R&D, largely around Ethereum 2.0,
      partially funded by the <a href="https://ethereum.org/">Ethereum Foundation</a>. I'm mostly
      interested in making sure that the protocol serves the application layer. I
      also like hacking and (very) occasionally angel investing.

      When it comes to creating an equitable, free society, I believe there's a
      bad way and a good way to build systems. I'm committed to exploring the
      good way. I think we should all have a choice of which systems and
      institutions to be a part of.

      In the past, I've been an engineer, data scientist, and startup founder.
      Google me to find me on your favorite professional profile website, but
      don't expect it to be up to date. Better to just see what I'm up to on
      <a href="https://twitter.com/lakshmansankar">Twitter</a>.
