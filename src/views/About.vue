      Hi, I'm Lakshman. I'm an <a href="https://ethereum.org/">Etherean</a>.
      I've spent the last couple years working in R&D and strategy at the
      Ethereum Foundation.
    </p>

    <br />

    <p>
      Most recently, I drove much of the thinking around supporting the budding
      proof-of-stake ecosystem after the launch of the
      <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/beacon-chain/">beacon chain</a>. One
      piece of legible work to come out of this was
      <a
        href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/02/09/esp-staking-community-grantee-announcement/"
        >a series of grants</a
      >. I was also deeply involved in staking pool R&D and thinking through how
      MEV affects L1 protocol development, and ZKP app R&D.
    </p>

    <br />

    <p>
      I'm currently deep in the 'crypto' startup idea maze. The industry is
      evolving and the time couldn't be better to double down on a vision and
      build something of century-scale importance.
    </p>
