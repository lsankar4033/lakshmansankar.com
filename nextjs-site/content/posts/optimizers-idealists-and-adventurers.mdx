'Optimizers, idealists, and adventurers' is a mental model for
  understanding how people structure their lives.

For those who aren't
  <a href="https://fs.blog/great-talks/a-lesson-on-worldly-wisdom/"
  >Munger disciples</a
>, I should clarify what I mean by 'mental model.' I don't mean a
generalization whose rules are perfectly predictive all of the time. This
isn't math. I mean a simple framework that is useful for understanding a
  facet of the world when considered alone that is useful for
    **real decision making** when combined with other mental
models.

I should give credit where it's due; my thinking on this model came out of
a conversation with
[Ray Cheng](https://raymondcheng.net/blog/) in late 2019. Ray
  stuck the model in my head.

The crux of the model is three dimensions on which people make decisions
about how to spend their time. The dimensions aren't perfectly orthogonal,
nor do they preclude one another. Maybe when the model settles more in my
mind, I'll find a closer-to-orthogonal set of dimensions. Doesn't mean the
model as I'm framing it isn't useful.

The optimizer dimension corresponds to the desire to improve one's own
position. Decisions that are primarily focused on individual gain.

The idealist dimension corresponds to the desire to improve everyone's
position. Decisions that are taken to help society or provide for others.
    There's a natural overlap with the optimizer dimension when we shrink the
  size of 'society'. For example, many people make decisions for the
    betterment of their families but to the detriment of their selves or
society at large.

The adventurer dimension corresponds to the desire to experience new
things. Decisions to exhilarate onself, explore unexplored frontiers, and
create unique memories. There's also an overlap here with the optimizer
dimension as this dimension is usually focused on self. But it doesn't
always overlap; adventures undertaken are usually done knowing that
they're not the best way to optimize. Another way to color the difference
in optimizer and adventurer is the

  >explore/exploit tradeoff</a
>. Although this doesn't perfectly capture what I mean here as adventuring
might be me undertaken without personal gain in mind.

I bundle the desire for erudition in with adventurer and optimizer, but I
  can see how pulling it out could improve this model in the future. TBD on
that.

When I have a difference in opinion with someone I know well about how to
spend a weekend or plan a career, our differences can usually be traced to
our relative positions in optimizer/idealist/adventurer space.

When it comes to describing an idea, I prefer describing the rules to
describing examples. That's just how my mind works; perhaps a byproduct of
studying physics for the first couple decades of my life. I'll stretch
  myself here to pull a few examples out. These are intentionally reductive;
no one is so simplistic as any of these examples.

Consider the weekend warrior. Grinding for money/status during the week
  and climbing everest and doing tough mudders on the weekend. Probably an
example of a optimizer/adventurer.

Or how about the tech-optimist venture capitalist. Who truly believes that
technology makes the world better and wants to be an arbiter of that
change. Maybe an optimizer/idealist.

And of course, there's the revolutionary. A path less traveled, sure, but
if you had to put Che Guevara in this model, he'd probably be more
  idealist/adventurer than optimizer.

Again, extremely reductive; the model has only been useful to me when I've
used a more nuanced cocktail of the three dimensions.
